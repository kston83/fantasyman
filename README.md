Setting Up Python Environment on CentOS 8 Server
This guide will walk you through setting up a Python environment on a CentOS 8 server, including any necessary libraries and dependencies.

Step 1: Update the System
Before installing any software, it is recommended to update the system with the latest packages. To update the system, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo yum update
Step 2: Install Python
Python is not installed by default on CentOS 8, so you will need to install it manually. To install Python, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo yum install python3
Step 3: Install Pip
Pip is a package manager for Python, which allows you to install and manage Python libraries and dependencies. To install Pip, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo yum install python3-pip
Step 4: Install Required Libraries and Dependencies
Depending on your project requirements, you may need to install additional libraries and dependencies. You can use Pip to install these packages. For example, to install the requests library, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip3 install requests
Conclusion
By following these steps, you should now have a Python environment set up on your CentOS 8 server, along with any necessary libraries and dependencies.

And here is a bash script that automates the setup process:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Update system
sudo yum update -y

# Install Python and Pip
sudo yum install python3 python3-pip -y

# Install required libraries and dependencies
pip3 install requests
Save the above code in a file named setup.sh and execute it with the command sudo sh setup.sh to setup the Python environment on your CentOS 8 server. Note that you may need to modify the script to install additional libraries and dependencies as per your project requirements.
